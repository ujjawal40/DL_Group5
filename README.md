<h1>Final-Project-Group5</h1>
<h2>Deep Learning Models for Brain Tumor Segmentation on BraTS 2024 Dataset</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This repository showcases the collaborative efforts of Group 5 in developing deep learning models, specifically UNet3D and Residual UNet3D, for the successful segmentation of brain tumor regions (ET, SNFH, NETC, RC) as part of the BRATS 2024 competition. It includes both individual contributions and comprehensive group projects that adhere to the professor's instructions.</p>

<h3>Repository Structure</h3>
<p>This repository is organized into several key folders, each serving a specific purpose in the project:</p>

<h4>1. Final Group Project Report</h4>
<p>Contains the final group project report in PDF format as instructed.</p>

<h4>2. Final Group Project Presentation</h4>
<p>Includes the presentation in PDF format used to showcase our project findings and methodologies.</p>

<h4>3. Project Group Proposal</h4>
<p>Holds the initial project proposal in PDF format, outlining the objectives, expected outcomes, and methodologies.</p>

<h4>4. Code</h4>
<p>This directory contains the source code and resources developed for the project:</p>
<blockquote style="background-color: #f9f9f9; border-left: 10px solid #ccc; margin: 1.5em 10px; padding: 0.5em 10px;">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Detailed instructions on how to run the models developed, set up Streamlit, and other setup details are provided in a README file within the Code folder. Make sure to review these instructions thoroughly to avoid any roadblocks in using the models.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Code_files</strong>: Includes scripts, notes, and resources directly related to the project's main objectives.</li>
    <li><strong>Models</strong>: Houses the developed models, including UNet3D and Residual UNet3D.</li>
    <li><strong>Trial-Prototype-Codes</strong>: Contains preliminary codes and prototype scripts. It's important to note that the contents of this folder are for trial and error purposes only and do not directly impact the functionality or performance of the main models or the Streamlit application. These scripts serve as a record of our exploratory coding and testing efforts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the repository includes four individual student folders, each containing specific codes and reports related to their contributions to the project.</p>
